- 👋 Hi, this is the profile of a BBA graduate who is working hard to fulfill his childhood dream which didn't happen due to some blah blah blah reason. Well, his name is Amit Kumar and that is me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, CSS and HTML
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaboration because I'm still learning.
